 ask for input from user
 re prompt the question if the user doesnt give a postive integer from one to eight

start a for loop for each line depending on the number the user inserts
    a for loop to print the number of first spaces in each line
    a for loop to print the number of first set of # in the line
    a for loop to print the middle spaces for the line
    a for loop to print the last set of # in the line
    move to the next line 
end the for loop
